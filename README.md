This is an easier Typescript start with Solid, Webpack 5 and TailwindCSS(jit). Updated for 1.1.

Uses webpack for bundling, Typescript for static typing, ESLint for linting the code and Prettier for automatic code formatting if VSCode is used.

Supports debugging

* Installation

Uses pnpm. Installation [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).

Install dependencies with `pnpm i`.

Start with `pnpm start`. Dev mode with `pnpm dev`. Test with `pnpm test`.

Debugging - start App in dev mode, and then run debugger. Reload Firefox at this point, and ignore

the warning from debugger extension if it appears. Breakpoints should work.
